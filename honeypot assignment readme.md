Time Spent: 10 Hours

Objective: Create a honeynet using MHN-Admin. As soon as the honeypot went live, I personally probed it using a Kali Linux implementation. The honeynet caught and registered my attack, along with thousands of others from locations across the world. 

The MHN Admin Deployment proceeded as outlined in the assignment instrcutions using the GCP to deploy it. I struggled the most on this part due to difficulty with the Google cloud and a lack of familiarity with the environment. I had to create multiple projects and attempt to create the MHN Admin several times before I was able to properly deploy it. (GIF unavaliable; I shut the project down before starting on the readme)

The dionaea gathers the IP address along with other useful information from every client to makes contact with it. This allows it to keep a record of any potential attackers. (GIF unavaliable; I shut the project down before starting on the readme)

MHN-Admin uses the MongoDB as its RDBMS. The JSON file records all of the information gathered by the dionaea honeypot. 

I had a lot of difficulty deploying the MHN-Admin. I had to create multiple projects and attempt the deployment serveral times before I was successful. This was due to errors on my part due to unfamilairity with the GCP environment. Once I became more familiar with the GCP environment, the project went smoothly from there.
